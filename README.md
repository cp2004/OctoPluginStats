# OctoPluginStats
Github Pages site tracking my OctoPrint plugin statistics over time.

# Warning - this is currently out of date since the site switched to React/Next.js. Currently, configuration is in `configuration.js`

## Want to use this to track your own stats? Feel free!
And I'll even give you a little how-to. After forking this repository:

1. Delete the stats file, `data/stats.json`, or replace it with `{}` (empty JSON)
2. Edit the list of plugin **ids** in the `scripts/get_data.py` file, [here](https://github.com/cp2004/OctoPluginStats/blob/daf91dad6867dfc3b0fc266a2b921c3f872817b1/scripts/get_data.py#L14-L19)
3. Run the script, either using the Github action (manually triggered) or via `python scripts/get_data.py` to generate the initial data
4. Update the name mapping in the `static/js/name_map.js` file [here](https://github.com/cp2004/OctoPluginStats/blob/main/static/js/name_map.js), 
mapping plugin id to human readable name.
5. Update the links in `_includes/navbar.html` & the name in `index.html` to your own ones, not mine!
6. Make sure you have enabled the actions in repository settings. Last time I checked actions were disabled for forks by default.

That should be all, if you have any questions let me know!
